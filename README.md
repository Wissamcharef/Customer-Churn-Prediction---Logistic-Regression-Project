# Customer-Churn-Prediction---Logistic-Regression-Project
You have been hired as a data scientist at a telecommunications company. Your manager has provided you with a customer dataset and asked you to build a predictive model to identify customers who are likely to churn (leave the company).

# We built two models.

# In the first one, 
we explored the dataset and trained and tested the data using three models:
Random Forest
Logistic Regression
Support Vector Machine (SVM)

We then looped through the models, applied Grid Search to each one, and displayed the results in order to compare their performance.

We found that Logistic Regression achieved the best results and the highest accuracy, so we continued by fine-tuning the Logistic Regression model.
All the remaining tasks were completed using this optimized model.
You can find this version of the project in ML Model.ipynb.

# As for the Logistic Regression–only model,
where we study the dataset using only Logistic Regression, it is available in only logistic regression model.ipynb.
