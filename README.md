# Customer-Churn-Prediction — Logistic Regression Project

You have been hired as a data scientist at a telecommunications company. Your manager has provided you with a customer dataset and asked you to build a predictive model to identify customers who are likely to churn (leave the company).

# Project Overview
Two Modeling Approaches
1. Model Comparison

In the first approach, we explored the dataset and trained and tested the data using three models:

Random Forest

Logistic Regression

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

We then looped through the models, applied Grid Search to each one, and displayed the results to compare their performance.

Outcome: Logistic Regression achieved the best results and highest accuracy. We then fine-tuned the Logistic Regression model and completed the remaining tasks using this optimized version.

2. Logistic Regression–Only Model

In this approach, we focused exclusively on Logistic Regression, studying the dataset and building the model without comparing it to other algorithms.
